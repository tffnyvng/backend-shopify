# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start:server`

Will run the db.json.
Open [http://localhost:4000/items](http://localhost:4000/items) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This app is not complete. It should be able to delete any item correctly, however the state does not update until it is refreshed. It is also able to edit but only the first item and will also not update until it is refreshed. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to debug these issues in time.
